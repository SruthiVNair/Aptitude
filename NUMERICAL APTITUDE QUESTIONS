the least perfect square number which is exactly divisible by 3, 4, 7, 10 and 12 is: 
 |-------------------------
            2 | 3, 2, 7,  5,   6  
               |------------------------ 
            3 | 3, 1, 7,  5,   3 
               |------------------------
            5 | 1. 1. 7,  5,  1
               |------------------------
            7 | 1, 1, 7,  1, 1
               |------------------------
               | 1, 1, 1,  1, 1

L.C. of 3, 4, 7 10 and 12 = 2*2*3*5*7 = 420

In the above factorization, 3, 5 and 7 are not in pairs, we have to multiply 420 by 3*5*7 

= 420*3*5*7  

= 44100

âˆš44100 = 210

(((((2)))))
Find the greatest number that will divide 43, 91 and 183 so as to leave the same remainder in each case. 

   If three nos as in this case is 43, 91 and 183 are given then to find HCF the shortest solution is take the diff:

1) 91 - 43 = 48 (4*3*7)
2) 183 - 91 = 92 (4*23)
3) 183 - 43 = 140 (4*7*5)

Thus the HCF is 4.

Find the largest number, smaller than the smallest four-digit number, which when divided by 4,5,6 and 7 leaves a remainder 2 in each case?
LCM of 4,5,6,7 =420
Hence next multiple of 420 is 840
the largest number, smaller than the smallest four-digit number, which is exactly divisble by 4,5,6 and 7 is 840
the largest number, smaller than the smallest four-digit number, which when divided by 4,5,6 and 7 leaves a remainder 2 in each case is=840+2=842

 In how many ways can a number 6084 be written as a product of two different factors ?
 
Factorising 6084 :

6084 = 2^2 x 3^2 x 13^2

If N = a^p b^q c^r, where a,b,c are primes,

Number of factors is represented by :

(p+1)(q+1)(r+1)

=> (2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 27

Number of Ordered pairs of any two factors is ( 27 + 1)/2 = 14

Since 6084 is a perfect square, evidently the ordered pair (78,78) is also counted in the above 14 pairs.

So, the number of ways in which 6084 can be expressed as a product of two different factors is 13.
